# Bulma-Sites
These are simple websites desgined with Bulma. It's a tiny project I've made to test Bulma and see how it looks.

## How to execute

This project comes with a basic Express server to display the websites. Therefore, `NodeJS` and `NPM` are required.

All that is needed then is to install the dependencies and start the server:

```
cd <project-folder>
npm install
npm start
```

This will host the server running locally on port 3000. Bulma and Font Awesome dependencies are not bundled with this project, they are retrieved through their respective CDNs.
